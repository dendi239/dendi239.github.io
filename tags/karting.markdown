This is home for all my karting related posts.
I started doing karting in May 2021 and quickly become obsessed with it.
I spend tons of time and money on karting and I'm very happy doing it.

Prior to karting, I actually had some experience with simracing.
I didn't get on top level, but did learn quite a bit from it.
Yet still, I had tons of online races, so you can discover results [there][kudosprime-account].

You can checkout some of my competitive results right at [sodiwseries][sodiwseries-account].
Althgough, not every karting competition I participated at using that system, even though if they're using sodi karts.
