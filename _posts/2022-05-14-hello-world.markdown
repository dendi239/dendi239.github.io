## Hello

This is my blog.
It will be a place where I will write about my life and my thoughts.
Note that it's my blog, so I am free to do anything I want to.

## History

My [telegram channel][telegram-channel] served puproses of this blog, however it didn't quite work as expected: I ran into limitations of single message size, it didn't allow me to place images in the middle of the post and so on.
I tried [telegraph][telegraph] and it worked fine, but it's yet not the best solution.

## Features

However, it's not about things I want to do, it's more about what I can do with this.
Turns out, I can do something out of the box, like basic markdown.
Site navigation and some scripting is also possible.
However, there're plenty of things I still want to add:

- [ ] Dark mode
- [x] Pages with gropping by tags
- [ ] Image gallery for travel posts
- [x] Telegram instant view

Given its nature, those are problems to solve.
I could do it using some googling and coding, but I'm not sure how much time it will take.
Anyway, I'm happy with features I have now and hopefully I'll add more in the future.
