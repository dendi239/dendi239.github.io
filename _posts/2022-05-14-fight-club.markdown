I'm writing to you to explain why movie "Fight club" deserves a place on top ten best films DVD.
Here's a brief plot:

The main character stuck in meaningless loop where they can't differ one day from the other and all they care about is to upgrade some piece of their interrior.
Running into Tayler changes their life completely.
Their apartment destroyed mysteriously, now roomates with Taylor, they start the Fight Club together.
That led to Project Mayhem, the narrator is failing to stop. Taylor turns out to be a different personality in the narrator's mind.

This thrilling movie to watch keeps tension high without time-wasters showing how easy is to belive something and how hard is to prove the obvious â€” even rewatching only hightlights the lack of the narrator's name.
Moreover, in no situation the narrator and Tayler are distinctive despite interactions with others.

The Fight Club reveals the dedicated man brave enough to challenge society grounds to solve its problems.
That determination comes at a cost of comfortless living, blackmailing their ex-boss and working hard and barerly sleeping, which is awesome.

The best part of the film is in its open ending leaving the audience unaware of the outcome. One can find tons of arguments why the narrator survies, or fails to. 
Another can argue about the viability of the actual plan and if it would've worked.
However, neither of those changes the power of the pure wild idea of fixing society and determination that allows to execute that.
